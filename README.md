# Pharma clinical mouse trial

This project explores data from a sample anti-cancer pharmaceutical clincal trial. The data reflects clinical drug trials in mice aimed at screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. 

In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of a "drug of interest" - Capomulin - versus the other treatment regimens. 

Data analysis was done within a jupyter notebook, with some summary graphs produced using the Matploylib library for Python.
